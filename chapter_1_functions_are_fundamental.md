# Chapter 3: Functions are fundamental
* All functions have a property named `name` that stores the function's name as a string. Functions with no name still possess this property, set to the empty string. Please be aware in the following sample, the function `name` is still empty string.
      var shout = function() {};
* The `!!` construct is a simple way of turning any JavaScript expression into its Boolean equivalent
